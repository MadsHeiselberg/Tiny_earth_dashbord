# Tiny Earth Dashboard
Welcome to the Tiny Earth Dashboard repository!

## Overview
This repository hosts the development of a dashboard designed for students participating in the Tiny Earth program. The Tiny Earth program focuses on empowering students to discover new antibiotics from soil bacteria, ultimately addressing the global health threat of antibiotic resistance.

## Goals for the App
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide students with easy access to the diversity of bacteria they have collected and grown in the lab during their participation in the Tiny Earth program. By offering a user-friendly interface, the dashboard aims to expand students' understanding of the genetic diversity present in bacterial genomes and their phylogenetic evolution.

## Features
Bacterial Diversity Visualization: Visual representations of the various bacteria collected and grown in the lab.
Genetic Genome Exploration: Tools for exploring the genetic makeup of different bacteria.
Phylogenetic Evolution Analysis: Features for studying the evolutionary relationships between different bacterial strains.
